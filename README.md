# Online-Learning-Labs

These Matlab laboratories were developed when I attended the course *"055047 - ONLINE LEARNING AND MONITORING"* during my studies at *Politecnico di Milano*

The original lab codes have been provided by the course professors Boracchi and Trov√≤, with some missing parts to be completed. My task was to complete the code of the Matlab algorithms using what I learned from the lessons.

In particular these labs deals with the following topics of _Online Machine Learning_ :
+ __Anomaly Detection__ and __Domain Adaption__
+ __Multi Armed Bandit__ algorithms and __Expert Learning__ algorithms


# Topics

+ __LAB 1/2/3/4__ : set of techniques for learning in non-stationary environments. The goal is to detect a change of the input distribution in a stream of data and to consequently adapt the online learner to those changes, in order to improve the predition accuracy of the new incoming samples.
+ __LAB 5__ : application of some online learning algorithms in the case we have a set of experts that gives feedbacks after the prediction (Expert Learning)
+ __LAB 6__ : application of some online learning algorithms in the case we have a limited feedback (Multi Armed Bandit --> Thompson Sampling and UCB1 algorithms)
+ __LAB 7__ : detection of anomalous heart signals, using PCA for dimensionality reduction of the initial dataset
+ __LAB 8__ : application of some online learning algorithms in the case we have a limited feedback and a non-stationary environment (Non-Stationary Multi Armed Bandit)
+ __LAB 9__ : an extension of LAB 8 where I implement some advanced NS-MAB algorithms, in order to show them during my oral examination
